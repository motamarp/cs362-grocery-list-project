# LETTUCE SAVE

This project, Lettuce Save, is a grocery-list creation and meal-planning application all in one, aiming to give users personalized profiles while allowing them to eat healthy and save time and money. We aim to make this a reality through organized lists and recipes for organization, price and store distance comparisons for products, healthy meal plan suggestions, and our other minor features. By prioritizing affordability, minimizing food waste, and simplifying the grocery shopping process, Lettuce Save aims to make meal planning more efficient and accessible for students, meal-preppers, and all home cooks alike.
